An interactive CPU scheduling simulator in which we can visualise how CPU schedules the processes according to their Arrival Time, Burst Time, Completion Time, etc. Furthermore, it also shows the average waiting time and average turnaround time succeding with the gantt chart.
You can choose the scheduling algorithm that you want to apply from FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority and also add the time quantum as per applicable.
